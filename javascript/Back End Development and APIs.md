# Managing Packages with NPM
npm (Node Package Manager), is a command line tool to install, create, and share packages of JavaScript code written for Node.js. There are many open source packages available on npm, so before starting a project, take some time to explore so you don't end up recreating the wheel for things like working with dates or fetching data from an API.

## How to Use package.json, the Core of Any Node.js Project or npm Package
The `package.json` file is the center of any Node.js project or npm package. It stores information about your project, similar to how the `head` section of an HTML document describes the content of a webpage. It consists of a single JSON object where information is stored in key-value pairs. There are only two required fields; `name` and `version`, but it’s good practice to provide additional information about your project that could be useful to future users or maintainers.

If you look at the file tree of your project, you will find the `package.json` file on the top level of the tree.

One of the most common pieces of information in this file is the `author` field. It specifies who created the project, and can consist of a string or an object with contact or other details. An object is recommended for bigger projects, but a simple string like the following example will do for this project.

```json
"author": "Jane Doe",
```

## Add a Description to Your package.json
The next part of a good package.json file is the `description` field; where a short, but informative description about your project belongs.

If some day you plan to publish a package to npm, this is the string that should sell your idea to the user when they decide whether to install your package or not. However, that’s not the only use case for the description, it’s a great way to summarize what a project does. It’s just as important in any Node.js project to help other developers, future maintainers or even your future self understand the project quickly.

## Add Keywords to Your package.json
The `keywords` field is where you can describe your project using related keywords. 

```json
"keywords": [ "descriptive", "related", "words" ],
```

## Add a License to Your package.json
The `license` field is where you inform users of what they are allowed to do with your project.

Some common licenses for open source projects include MIT and BSD. License information is not required, and copyright laws in most countries will give you ownership of what you create by default. However, it’s always a good practice to explicitly state what users can and can’t do. 

```json
"license": "MIT",
```

## Add a Version to Your package.json
A `version` is one of the required fields of your package.json file. This field describes the current version of your project.

```json
"version": "1.2.0",
```

## Expand Your Project with External Packages from npm
One of the biggest reasons to use a package manager, is their powerful dependency management. Instead of manually having to make sure that you get all dependencies whenever you set up a project on a new computer, npm automatically installs everything for you. But how can npm know exactly what your project needs? Meet the `dependencies` section of your package.json file.

In this section, packages your project requires are stored using the following format:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "package-name": "version",
  "express": "4.14.0"
}
```

## Manage npm Dependencies By Understanding Semantic Versioning
`Versions` of the npm packages in the dependencies section of your package.json file follow what’s called Semantic Versioning (SemVer), an industry standard for software versioning aiming to make it easier to manage dependencies. Libraries, frameworks or other tools published on npm should use SemVer in order to clearly communicate what kind of changes projects can expect if they update.

Knowing SemVer can be useful when you develop software that uses external dependencies (which you almost always do). One day, your understanding of these numbers will save you from accidentally introducing breaking changes to your project without understanding why things that worked yesterday suddenly don’t work today. This is how Semantic Versioning works according to the official website:

```json
"package": "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"
```

The MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes. The MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. The PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. This means that PATCHes are bug fixes and MINORs add new features but neither of them break what worked before. Finally, MAJORs add changes that won’t work with earlier versions.

## Use the Tilde-Character to Always Use the Latest Patch Version of a Dependency
In the last challenge, you told npm to only include a specific version of a package. That’s a useful way to freeze your dependencies if you need to make sure that different parts of your project stay compatible with each other. But in most use cases, you don’t want to miss bug fixes since they often include important security patches and (hopefully) don’t break things in doing so.

To allow an npm dependency to update to the latest PATCH version, you can prefix the dependency’s version with the tilde (`~`) character. Here's an example of how to allow updates to any `1.3.x` version.

```json
"package": "~1.3.8"
```

## Use the Caret-Character to Use the Latest Minor Version of a Dependency
Similar to how the tilde we learned about in the last challenge allows npm to install the latest PATCH for a dependency, the caret (`^`) allows npm to install future updates as well. The difference is that the caret will allow both MINOR updates and PATCHes.

Your current version of `@freecodecamp/example` should be `~1.2.13` which allows npm to install to the latest `1.2.x` version. If you were to use the caret (^) as a version prefix instead, npm would be allowed to update to any `1.x.x` version.

```json
"package": "^1.3.8"
```

## Remove a Package from Your Dependencies
But what if you want to remove an external package that you no longer need? You might already have guessed it, just remove the corresponding key-value pair for that package from your dependencies.

This same method applies to removing other fields in your package.json as well.


# Basic Node and Express
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to write backend (server-side) programs in JavaScript. Node.js comes with a handful of built-in modules — small, independent programs — that help with this. Some of the core modules include HTTP, which acts like a server, and File System, a module to read and modify files.

Express is a lightweight web application framework, and is one of the most popular packages on npm. Express makes it much easier to create a server and handle routing for your application, which handles things like directing people to the correct page when they visit a certain endpoint like /blog.
 
## Start a Working Express Server
One fundamental method is `app.listen(port)`. It tells your server to listen on a given port, putting it in running state.

Let’s serve our first string! In Express, routes takes the following structure: `app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)`. METHOD is an http method in lowercase. PATH is a relative path on the server (it can be a string, or even a regular expression). HANDLER is a function that Express calls when the route is matched. Handlers take the form `function(req, res) {...}`, where req is the request object, and res is the response object. For example, the handler

```js
function(req, res) {
  res.send('Response String');
}
```

will serve the string 'Response String'.

```js
app.get("/", function(req, res) {
  res.send("Hello Express");
}); 
```

## Serve an HTML File
You can respond to requests with a file using the `res.sendFile(path)` method. You can put it inside the `app.get('/', ...)` route handler. Behind the scenes, this method will set the appropriate headers to instruct your browser on how to handle the file you want to send, according to its type. Then it will read and send the file. This method needs an absolute file path. We recommend you to use the Node global variable `__dirname` to calculate the path like this:

```js
absolutePath = __dirname + '/relativePath/file.ext'
```

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/views/index.html');
});
```

## Serve Static Assets
An HTML server usually has one or more directories that are accessible by the user. You can place there the static assets needed by your application (stylesheets, scripts, images).

In Express, you can put in place this functionality using the middleware `express.static(path)`, where the `path` parameter is the absolute path of the folder containing the assets.

Basically, middleware are functions that intercept route handlers, adding some kind of information. A middleware needs to be mounted using the method `app.use(path, middlewareFunction)`. The first `path` argument is optional. If you don’t pass it, the middleware will be executed for all requests.

```js
app.use('/public', express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
```

## Serve JSON on a Specific Route
While an HTML server serves HTML, an API serves data. A REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API allows data exchange in a simple way, without the need for clients to know any detail about the server. The client only needs to know where the resource is (the URL), and the action it wants to perform on it (the verb). The GET verb is used when you are fetching some information, without modifying anything. These days, the preferred data format for moving information around the web is JSON. Simply put, JSON is a convenient way to represent a JavaScript object as a string, so it can be easily transmitted.

Let's create a simple API by creating a route that responds with JSON at the path `/json`. You can do it as usual, with the `app.get()` method. Inside the route handler, use the method `res.json()`, passing in an object as an argument. This method closes the request-response loop, returning the data. Behind the scenes, it converts a valid JavaScript object into a string, then sets the appropriate headers to tell your browser that you are serving JSON, and sends the data back. A valid object has the usual structure `{key: data}`. `data` can be a number, a string, a nested object or an array. `data` can also be a variable or the result of a function call, in which case it will be evaluated before being converted into a string.

```js
app.get('/json', (req, res) => {
  res.json({"message": "Hello json"});
})
```

## Use the .env File
The `.env` file is a hidden file that is used to pass environment variables to your application. This file is secret, no one but you can access it, and it can be used to store data that you want to keep private or hidden. For example, you can store API keys from external services or your database URI. You can also use it to store configuration options. By setting configuration options, you can change the behavior of your application, without the need to rewrite some code.

The environment variables are accessible from the app as `process.env.VAR_NAME`. The `process.env` object is a global Node object, and variables are passed as strings. By convention, the variable names are all uppercase, with words separated by an underscore. The `.env` is a shell file, so you don’t need to wrap names or values in quotes. It is also important to note that there cannot be space around the equals sign when you are assigning values to your variables, e.g. `VAR_NAME=value`. Usually, you will put each variable definition on a separate line.

```js
app.get('/json', (req, res) => {
  const messageStyle = process.env['MESSAGE_STYLE'];
  let response = "Hello json";

  if (messageStyle === 'uppercase') {
    response = response.toUpperCase(); 
  }
  res.json({"message": response});
})
```

## Implement a Root-Level Request Logger Middleware
Middleware functions are functions that take 3 arguments: the request object, the response object, and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle. These functions execute some code that can have side effects on the app, and usually add information to the request or response objects. They can also end the cycle by sending a response when some condition is met. If they don’t send the response when they are done, they start the execution of the next function in the stack. This triggers calling the 3rd argument, `next()`.

Look at the following example:

```js
function(req, res, next) {
  console.log("I'm a middleware...");
  next();
}
```

Let’s suppose you mounted this function on a route. When a request matches the route, it displays the string “I’m a middleware…”, then it executes the next function in the stack. In this exercise, you are going to build root-level middleware. As you have seen in challenge 4, to mount a middleware function at root level, you can use the `app.use(<mware-function>)` method. In this case, the function will be executed for all the requests, but you can also set more specific conditions. For example, if you want a function to be executed only for POST requests, you could use `app.post(<mware-function>)`. Analogous methods exist for all the HTTP verbs (GET, DELETE, PUT, …).

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.path} - ${req.ip}`);
  next();
});
```
 
## Chain Middleware to Create a Time Server
Middleware can be mounted at a specific route using `app.METHOD(path, middlewareFunction)`. Middleware can also be chained within a route definition.

Look at the following example:

```js
app.get('/user', function(req, res, next) {
  req.user = getTheUserSync();  // Hypothetical synchronous operation
  next();
}, function(req, res) {
  res.send(req.user);
});
```

This approach is useful to split the server operations into smaller units. That leads to a better app structure, and the possibility to reuse code in different places. This approach can also be used to perform some validation on the data. At each point of the middleware stack you can block the execution of the current chain and pass control to functions specifically designed to handle errors. Or you can pass control to the next matching route, to handle special cases.

```js
app.get('/now', (req, res, next) => {
  req.time = new Date().toString();
  next();
}, (req, res) => {
  res.json({time: req.time});
});
```

## Get Route Parameter Input from the Client
When building an API, we have to allow users to communicate to us what they want to get from our service. For example, if the client is requesting information about a user stored in the database, they need a way to let us know which user they're interested in. One possible way to achieve this result is by using route parameters. Route parameters are named segments of the URL, delimited by slashes (/). Each segment captures the value of the part of the URL which matches its position. The captured values can be found in the `req.params` object.

```
route_path: '/user/:userId/book/:bookId'
actual_request_URL: '/user/546/book/6754'
req.params: {userId: '546', bookId: '6754'}
```

```js
app.get('/:word/echo', (req, res) => {
  res.json({echo: req.params.word});
});
```

## Get Query Parameter Input from the Client
Another common way to get input from the client is by encoding the data after the route path, using a query string. The query string is delimited by a question mark (?), and includes field=value couples. Each couple is separated by an ampersand (&). Express can parse the data from the query string, and populate the object `req.query`. Some characters, like the percent (%), cannot be in URLs and have to be encoded in a different format before you can send them. If you use the API from JavaScript, you can use specific methods to encode/decode these characters.

```
route_path: '/library'
actual_request_URL: '/library?userId=546&bookId=6754'
req.query: {userId: '546', bookId: '6754'}
```

**Note:** In the following exercise you are going to receive data from a POST request, at the same `/name` route path. If you want, you can use the method `app.route(path).get(handler).post(handler)`. This syntax allows you to chain different verb handlers on the same path route. You can save a bit of typing, and have cleaner code.

```js
app.get('/name', (req, res) => {
  res.json({name: `${req.query.first} ${req.query.last}`});
});
```

## Use body-parser to Parse POST Requests
Besides GET, there is another common HTTP verb, it is POST. POST is the default method used to send client data with HTML forms. In REST convention, POST is used to send data to create new items in the database (a new user, or a new blog post). You don’t have a database in this project, but you are going to learn how to handle POST requests anyway.

In these kind of requests, the data doesn’t appear in the URL, it is hidden in the request body. The body is a part of the HTTP request, also called the payload. Even though the data is not visible in the URL, this does not mean that it is private. To see why, look at the raw content of an HTTP POST request:

```
POST /path/subpath HTTP/1.0
From: john@example.com
User-Agent: someBrowser/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 20

name=John+Doe&age=25
```

As you can see, the body is encoded like the query string. This is the default format used by HTML forms. With Ajax, you can also use JSON to handle data having a more complex structure. There is also another type of encoding: multipart/form-data. This one is used to upload binary files. In this exercise, you will use a URL encoded body. To parse the data coming from POST requests, you must use the `body-parser` package. This package allows you to use a series of middleware, which can decode data in different formats.

---

The middleware to handle URL encoded data is returned by `bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false})`. Pass the function returned by the previous method call to `app.use()`. As usual, the middleware must be mounted before all the routes that depend on it.

**Note:** `extended` is a configuration option that tells `body-parser` which parsing needs to be used. When `extended=false` it uses the classic encoding `querystring` library. When `extended=true` it uses `qs` library for parsing.

When using `extended=false`, values can be only strings or arrays. The object returned when using `querystring` does not prototypically inherit from the default JavaScript `Object`, which means functions like `hasOwnProperty`, `toString` will not be available. The extended version allows more data flexibility, but it is outmatched by JSON.

```js
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}));
```

## Get Data from POST Requests
Mount a POST handler at the path `/name`. It’s the same path as before. We have prepared a form in the html frontpage. It will submit the same data of exercise 10 (Query string). If the body-parser is configured correctly, you should find the parameters in the object `req.body`. Have a look at the usual library example:

```
route: POST '/library'
urlencoded_body: userId=546&bookId=6754
req.body: {userId: '546', bookId: '6754'}
```

Tip: There are several other http methods other than GET and POST. And by convention there is a correspondence between the http verb, and the operation you are going to execute on the server. The conventional mapping is:

POST (sometimes PUT) - Create a new resource using the information sent with the request,

GET - Read an existing resource without modifying it,

PUT or PATCH (sometimes POST) - Update a resource using the data sent,

DELETE => Delete a resource.

There are also a couple of other methods which are used to negotiate a connection with the server. Except from GET, all the other methods listed above can have a payload (i.e. the data into the request body). The body-parser middleware works with these methods as well.

```js
app.post('/name', (req, res) => {
  res.json({name: `${req.body.first} ${req.body.last}`});
});
```


# MongoDB and Mongoose
MongoDB is a database application that stores JSON documents (or records) that you can use in your application. Unlike SQL, another type of database, MongoDB is a non-relational or "NoSQL" database. This means MongoDB stores all associated data within one record, instead of storing it across many preset tables as in a SQL database.

Mongoose is a popular npm package for interacting with MongoDB. With Mongoose, you can use plain JavaScript objects instead of JSON, which makes it easier to work with MongoDB. Also, it allows you to create blueprints for your documents called schemas, so you don't accidentally save the wrong type of data and cause bugs later.
 
## Install and Set Up Mongoose
`mongoose@^5.11.15` has been added to your project’s `package.json` file. First, require mongoose as `mongoose` in `myApp.js`. Next, create a `.env` file and add a `MONGO_URI` variable to it. Its value should be your MongoDB Atlas database URI. Be sure to surround the URI with single or double quotes, and remember that you can't use spaces around the `=` in environment variables. For example, `MONGO_URI='VALUE'`.

When you are done, connect to the database by calling the `connect` method within your `myApp.js` file by using the following syntax:

```js
mongoose.connect(<Your URI>, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
```

## Create a Model

### CRUD Part I - CREATE

First of all, we need a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection. It defines the shape of the documents within that collection. Schemas are building blocks for Models. They can be nested to create complex models, but in this case, we'll keep things simple. A model allows you to create instances of your objects, called documents.

Replit is a real server, and in real servers, the interactions with the database happen in handler functions. These functions are executed when some event happens (e.g. someone hits an endpoint on your API). We’ll follow the same approach in these exercises. The `done()` function is a callback that tells us that we can proceed after completing an asynchronous operation such as inserting, searching, updating, or deleting. It's following the Node convention, and should be called as `done(null, data)` on success, or `done(err)` on error.

Warning - When interacting with remote services, errors may occur!

```js
/* Example */

const someFunc = function(done) {
  //... do something (risky) ...
  if (error) return done(error);
  done(null, result);
};
```

#### Schema
While Mongo is schema-less, SQL defines a schema via the table definition. A Mongoose [_schema_](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#schemas) is a document data structure (or shape of the document) that is enforced via the application layer.

#### SchemaTypes
While Mongoose schemas define the overall structure or shape of a document, _[SchemaTypes](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html)_ define the expected data type for individual fields (`String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, and so on).

You can also pass in useful options like `required` to make a field non-optional, `default` to set a default value for the field, and many more.

The following Schema Types are permitted:

- Array
- Boolean
- Buffer
- Date
- Mixed (A generic / flexible data type)
- Number
- ObjectId
- String

#### Models
[_Models_](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html) are higher-order constructors that take a schema and create an instance of a document equivalent to records in a relational database.

```js
const puppySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  age: Number
});

const Puppy = mongoose.model('Puppy', puppySchema);
```

In the code above, `puppySchema` defines the shape of the document which has two fields, `name`, and `age`.

The `SchemaType` for `name` is `String` and for `age` is `Number`. Note that you can define the `SchemaType` for a field by using an object with a `type` property like with `name`. Or you can apply a `SchemaType` directly to the field like with `age`.

Also, notice that the `SchemaType` for `name` has the option `required` set to `true`. To use options like `required` and `lowercase` for a field, you need to use an object to set the `SchemaType`.

At the bottom of the snippet, `puppySchema` is compiled into a model named `Puppy`, which can then be used to construct documents in an application.

```js
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const personSchema = new Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  age: Number,
  favoriteFoods: [String]
});

let Person = mongoose.model('Person', personSchema);
```

## Create and Save a Record of a Model
Within the `createAndSavePerson` function, create a document instance using the `Person` model constructor you built before. Pass to the constructor an object having the fields `name`, `age`, and `favoriteFoods`. Their types must conform to the ones in the `personSchema`. Then, call the method `document.save()` on the returned document instance. Pass to it a callback using the Node convention. This is a common pattern; all the following CRUD methods take a callback function like this as the last argument.

```js
person.save(function(err, data) {
  //   ...do your stuff here...
});
```

```js
const createAndSavePerson = (done) => {
  let stephanie = new Person({
    name: "Stephanie",
    age: 32,
    favoriteFoods: ["tacos", "pozole"]
  });

  stephanie.save((err, data) => {
    if (err) return done(err);
    done(null, data);
  });  
};
```
 
## Create Many Records with model.create()
Sometimes you need to create many instances of your models, e.g. when seeding a database with initial data. `Model.create()` takes an array of objects like `[{name: 'John', ...}, {...}, ...]` as the first argument, and saves them all in the db.

```js
let arrayOfPeople = [
  {name: "Frankie", age: 74, favoriteFoods: ["Del Taco"]},
  {name: "Sol", age: 76, favoriteFoods: ["roast chicken"]},
  {name: "Robert", age: 78, favoriteFoods: ["wine"]}
];

const createManyPeople = (arrayOfPeople, done) => {
  Person.create(arrayOfPeople, (err, data) => {
    if (err) return done(err);
    done(null, data);
  });
};
```

## Use model.find() to Search Your Database
In its simplest usage, `Model.find()` accepts a query document (a JSON object) as the first argument, then a callback. It returns an array of matches. It supports an extremely wide range of search options.

```js
const findPeopleByName = (personName, done) => {
  Person.find({name: personName}, (err, data) => {
    if (err) return done(err);
    done(null, data);
  });
};
```

## Use model.findOne() to Return a Single Matching Document from Your Database
`Model.findOne()` behaves like `Model.find()`, but it returns only one document (not an array), even if there are multiple items. It is especially useful when searching by properties that you have declared as unique.

```js
const findOneByFood = (food, done) => {
  Person.findOne({favoriteFoods: food}, (err, data) => {
    if (err) return done(err);
    done(null, data);
  });
};
```

## Use model.findById() to Search Your Database By `_id`
When saving a document, MongoDB automatically adds the field `_id`, and set it to a unique alphanumeric key. Searching by `_id` is an extremely frequent operation, so Mongoose provides a dedicated method for it.

```js
const findPersonById = (personId, done) => {
  Person.findById(personId, (err, data) => {
    if (err) return done(err);
    done(null, data);
  });
};
```

## Perform Classic Updates by Running Find, Edit, then Save
In the good old days, this was what you needed to do if you wanted to edit a document, and be able to use it somehow (e.g. sending it back in a server response). Mongoose has a dedicated updating method: `Model.update()`. It is bound to the low-level mongo driver. It can bulk-edit many documents matching certain criteria, but it doesn’t send back the updated document, only a 'status' message. Furthermore, it makes model validations difficult, because it just directly calls the mongo driver.

---

**Note:** This may be tricky, if in your Schema, you declared `favoriteFoods` as an Array, without specifying the type (i.e. `[String]`). In that case, `favoriteFoods` defaults to Mixed type, and you have to manually mark it as edited using `document.markModified('edited-field')`. See our [Mongoose article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/introduction-to-mongoose-for-mongodb-d2a7aa593c57/).

```js
const findEditThenSave = (personId, done) => {
  const foodToAdd = "hamburger";
  Person.findById(personId, (err, personFound) => {
    if (err) return done(err);
    personFound.favoriteFoods.push(foodToAdd);
    personFound.save((err, personUpdated) => {
      if (err) return done(err);
      done(null, personUpdated);
    });
  });
};
```

## Perform New Updates on a Document Using model.findOneAndUpdate()
Recent versions of Mongoose have methods to simplify documents updating. Some more advanced features (i.e. pre/post hooks, validation) behave differently with this approach, so the classic method is still useful in many situations. `findByIdAndUpdate()` can be used when searching by id.

---

**Note:** You should return the updated document. To do that, you need to pass the options document `{ new: true }` as the 3rd argument to `findOneAndUpdate()`. By default, these methods return the unmodified object.

```js
const findAndUpdate = (personName, done) => {
  const ageToSet = 20;
  Person.findOneAndUpdate({name: personName}, {age: ageToSet}, {new: true}, (err, personFound) => {
    if (err) return done(err);
    done(null, personFound);
  });
};
```

## Delete One Document Using model.findByIdAndRemove
`findByIdAndRemove` and `findOneAndRemove` are like the previous update methods. They pass the removed document to the db. As usual, use the function argument `personId` as the search key.

```js
const removeById = (personId, done) => {
  Person.findByIdAndRemove(personId, (err, personRemoved) => {

## Delete Many Documents with model.remove()
`Model.remove()` is useful to delete all the documents matching given criteria.

---

**Note:** The `Model.remove()` doesn’t return the deleted document, but a JSON object containing the outcome of the operation, and the number of items affected. 

```js
const removeManyPeople = (done) => {
  const nameToRemove = "Mary";
  Person.remove({name: nameToRemove}, (err, response) => {
    if (err) return done(err);
    done(null, response);
  });
};
```

## Chain Search Query Helpers to Narrow Search Results
If you don’t pass the callback as the last argument to `Model.find()` (or to the other search methods), the query is not executed. You can store the query in a variable for later use. This kind of object enables you to build up a query using chaining syntax. The actual db search is executed when you finally chain the method `.exec()`. You always need to pass your callback to this last method. There are many query helpers, here we'll use the most commonly used.

--- 

Chain `.find()`, `.sort()`, `.limit()`, `.select()`, and then `.exec()`. Pass the `done(err, data)` callback to `exec()`.

```js
const queryChain = (done) => {
  const foodToSearch = "burrito";
  Person
    .find({favoriteFoods: foodToSearch})
    .sort({name: 1})
    .limit(2)
    .select({age: 0})
    .exec((err, data) => {
      if (err) return done(err);
      done(null, data);
    });
};
```
