**Functional Programming is another popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs.**

# Learn About Functional Programming
Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT

Functional programming is about:

1. Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change
2. Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output
3. Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

## Challenge
In the code editor, the prepareTea and getTea functions are already defined for you. Call the getTea function to get 40 cups of tea for the team, and store them in the tea4TeamFCC variable.
```js
// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareTea = () => 'greenTea';

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

// Only change code below this line
const tea4TeamFCC = getTea(40);
// Only change code above this line
```
# Understand Functional Programming Terminology
*Callbacks* are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. 

Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called *first class* functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value, are called *higher order* functions.

When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a *lambda*.

## Challenge
Prepare 27 cups of green tea and 13 cups of black tea and store them in tea4GreenTeamFCC and tea4BlackTeamFCC variables, respectively. Note that the getTea function has been modified so it now takes a function as the first argument.
```js
// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of black tea
const prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

// Only change code below this line
const tea4GreenTeamFCC = getTea(prepareGreenTea, 27);
const tea4BlackTeamFCC = getTea(prepareBlackTea, 13);
// Only change code above this line

console.log(
  tea4GreenTeamFCC,
  tea4BlackTeamFCC
);
```
# Understand the Hazards of Using Imperative Code
Functional programming is a good habit. It keeps your code easy to manage, and saves you from sneaky bugs. But before we get there, let's look at an imperative approach to programming to highlight where you may have issues.

In English (and many other languages), the imperative tense is used to give commands. Similarly, an imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.

Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. A classic example is writing a for loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.

In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.

JavaScript offers many predefined methods that handle common tasks so you don't need to write out how the computer should perform them. For example, instead of using the for loop mentioned above, you could call the map method which handles the details of iterating over an array. This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the "Off By One Errors" that were covered in the Debugging section.

# Avoid Mutations and Side Effects Using Functional Programming
If you haven't already figured it out, the issue in the previous challenge was with the splice call in the tabClose() function. Unfortunately, splice changes the original array it is called on, so the second call to it used a modified array, and gave unexpected results.

This is a small example of a much larger pattern - you call a function on a variable, array, or an object, and the function changes the variable or something in the object.

One of the core principles of functional programming is to not change things. Changes lead to bugs. It's easier to prevent bugs knowing that your functions don't change anything, including the function arguments or any global variable.

The previous example didn't have any complicated operations but the splice method changed the original array, and resulted in a bug.

Recall that in functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome is called a side effect. A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.

Let's try to master this discipline and not alter any variable or object in our code.

## Challenge
Fill in the code for the function incrementer so it returns the value of the global variable fixedValue increased by one.
```js
// The global variable
let fixedValue = 4;

function incrementer() {
  // Only change code below this line
  return fixedValue + 1;
  // Only change code above this line
}
```
# Pass Arguments to Avoid External Dependence in a Function
The last challenge was a step closer to functional programming principles, but there is still something missing.

We didn't alter the global variable value, but the function incrementer would not work without the global variable fixedValue being there.

Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.

There are several good consequences from this principle. The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, and it won't depend on anything else in your program.

This can give you more confidence when you alter, remove, or add new code. You would know what you can or cannot change and you can see where the potential traps are.

Finally, the function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it.

# Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions
So far, we have seen two distinct principles for functional programming:

1. Don't alter a variable or object - create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function. Hint: using something like const newArr = arrVar, where arrVar is an array will simply create a reference to the existing variable and not a copy. So changing a value in newArr would change the value in arrVar.
2. Declare function parameters - any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments passed to the function, and not on any global object or variable.

## Challenge
Rewrite the code so the global array bookList is not changed inside either function. The add function should add the given bookName to the end of the array passed to it and return a new array (list). The remove function should remove the given bookName from the array passed to it.
```js
// The global variable
const bookList = ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"];

// Change code below this line
function add(bookList, bookName) {
  let newBookList = [...bookList];

  newBookList.push(bookName);
  return newBookList;
  
  // Change code above this line
}

// Change code below this line
function remove(bookList, bookName) {
  const book_index = bookList.indexOf(bookName);
  let newBookList = [...bookList];

  if (book_index >= 0) {

    newBookList.splice(book_index, 1);
    return newBookList;

    // Change code above this line
    }
}
```
# Use the map Method to Extract Data from an Array
So far we have learned to use pure functions to avoid side effects in a program. Also, we have seen the value in having a function only depend on its input arguments.

This is only the beginning. As its name suggests, functional programming is centered around a theory of functions.

It would make sense to be able to pass them as arguments to other functions, and return a function from another function. Functions are considered first class objects in JavaScript, which means they can be used like any other object. They can be saved in variables, stored in an object, or passed as function arguments.

Let's start with some simple array functions, which are methods on the array object prototype. In this exercise we are looking at Array.prototype.map(), or more simply map.

The map method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element. It does this without mutating the original array.

When the callback is used, it is passed three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the map method was called.

See below for an example using the map method on the users array to return a new array containing only the names of the users as elements. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.
```js
const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const names = users.map(user => user.name);
console.log(names);
```
## Challenge
The watchList array holds objects with information on several movies. Use map on watchList to assign a new array of objects to the ratings variable. Each movie in the new array should have only a title key with the name of the film, and a rating key with the IMDB rating. The code in the editor currently uses a for loop to do this, so you should replace the loop functionality with your map expression.
```js
// The global variable
const watchList = [

  ratings.push({title: watchList[i]["Title"], rating: watchList[i]["imdbRating"]});
}*/

// Only change code above this line

console.log(JSON.stringify(ratings));
```
# Implement map on a Prototype
As you have seen from applying Array.prototype.map(), or simply map() earlier, the map method returns an array of the same length as the one it was called on. It also doesn't alter the original array, as long as its callback function doesn't.

In other words, map is a pure function, and its output depends solely on its inputs. Plus, it takes another function as its argument.

## Challenge
Write your own Array.prototype.myMap(), which should behave exactly like Array.prototype.map(). You should not use the built-in map method. The Array instance can be accessed in the myMap method using this.
```js
Array.prototype.myMap = function(callback) {
  const newArray = [];
  // Only change code below this line
  for(let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    newArray.push(callback(this[i], i, this));
  }
  // Only change code above this line
  return newArray;
};
```
# Use the filter Method to Extract Data from an Array
Another useful array function is Array.prototype.filter(), or simply filter().

filter calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new array containing only the elements for which that function returns a truthy value - that is, a value which returns true if passed to the Boolean() constructor. In other words, it filters the array, based on the function passed to it. Like map, it does this without needing to modify the original array.

The callback function accepts three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the filter method was called.

See below for an example using the filter method on the users array to return a new array containing only the users under the age of 30. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.
```js
const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const usersUnder30 = users.filter(user => user.age < 30);
console.log(usersUnder30); 
```
The console would display the value ```[ { name: 'Amy', age: 20 }, { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 } ]```.

## Challenge
The variable watchList holds an array of objects with information on several movies. Use a combination of filter and map on watchList to assign a new array of objects with only title and rating keys. The new array should only include objects where imdbRating is greater than or equal to 8.0. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and you may need to convert them into numbers to perform mathematical operations on them.
```js
// The global variable
const watchList = [

  }

};
```
# Return Part of an Array Using the slice Method
The slice method returns a copy of certain elements of an array. It can take two arguments, the first gives the index of where to begin the slice, the second is the index for where to end the slice (and it's non-inclusive). If the arguments are not provided, the default is to start at the beginning of the array through the end, which is an easy way to make a copy of the entire array. The slice method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one.

# Remove Elements from an Array Using slice Instead of splice
A common pattern while working with arrays is when you want to remove items and keep the rest of the array. JavaScript offers the splice method for this, which takes arguments for the index of where to start removing items, then the number of items to remove. If the second argument is not provided, the default is to remove items through the end. However, the splice method mutates the original array it is called on. 

# Combine Two Arrays Using the concat Method
Concatenation means to join items end to end. JavaScript offers the concat method for both strings and arrays that work in the same way. For arrays, the method is called on one, then another array is provided as the argument to concat, which is added to the end of the first array. It returns a new array and does not mutate either of the original arrays. 
```js
[1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5, 6]);
```
The returned array would be ```[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]```.

# Add Elements to the End of an Array Using concat Instead of push
Functional programming is all about creating and using non-mutating functions.

Compare concat to the push method. push adds items to the end of the same array it is called on, which mutates that array.

# Use the reduce Method to Analyze Data
Array.prototype.reduce(), or simply reduce(), is the most general of all array operations in JavaScript. You can solve almost any array processing problem using the reduce method.

The reduce method allows for more general forms of array processing, and it's possible to show that both filter and map can be derived as special applications of reduce. The reduce method iterates over each item in an array and returns a single value (i.e. string, number, object, array). This is achieved via a callback function that is called on each iteration.

The callback function accepts four arguments. The first argument is known as the accumulator, which gets assigned the return value of the callback function from the previous iteration, the second is the current element being processed, the third is the index of that element and the fourth is the array upon which reduce is called.

In addition to the callback function, reduce has an additional parameter which takes an initial value for the accumulator. If this second parameter is not used, then the first iteration is skipped and the second iteration gets passed the first element of the array as the accumulator.

See below for an example using reduce on the users array to return the sum of all the users' ages. For simplicity, the example only uses the first and second arguments.
```js
const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const sumOfAges = users.reduce((sum, user) => sum + user.age, 0);
console.log(sumOfAges);
```
The console would display the value 64.

In another example, see how an object can be returned containing the names of the users as properties with their ages as values.
```js
const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const usersObj = users.reduce((obj, user) => {
  obj[user.name] = user.age;
  return obj;
}, {});
console.log(usersObj);
```
The console would display the value { John: 34, Amy: 20, camperCat: 10 }.

## Challenge
The variable watchList holds an array of objects with information on several movies. Use reduce to find the average IMDB rating of the movies directed by Christopher Nolan. Recall from prior challenges how to filter data and map over it to pull what you need. You may need to create other variables, and return the average rating from getRating function. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and need to be converted into numbers before they are used in any mathematical operations.
```js
// The global variable
const watchList = [

# Use Higher-Order Functions map, filter, or reduce to Solve a Complex Problem
## Challenge
Complete the code for the squareList function using any combination of map(), filter(), and reduce(). The function should return a new array containing the squares of only the positive integers (decimal numbers are not integers) when an array of real numbers is passed to it. An example of an array of real numbers is ```[-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2]```.

Note: Your function should not use any kind of for or while loops or the forEach() function.
```js
const squareList = arr => {
  // Only change code below this line
  return arr
    .filter(number => number > 0 && Number.isInteger(number))
    .map(number => number ** 2);
  
  // Only change code above this line
};

const squaredIntegers = squareList([-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2]);
console.log(squaredIntegers);
```
# Sort an Array Alphabetically using the sort Method
The sort method sorts the elements of an array according to the callback function.
```js
function ascendingOrder(arr) {
  return arr.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  });
}

ascendingOrder([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]);
```
This would return the value ```[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]```.
```js
function reverseAlpha(arr) {
  return arr.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a === b ? 0 : a < b ? 1 : -1;
  });
}

reverseAlpha(['l', 'h', 'z', 'b', 's']);
```
This would return the value ```['z', 's', 'l', 'h', 'b']```.

JavaScript's default sorting method is by string Unicode point value, which may return unexpected results. Therefore, it is encouraged to provide a callback function to specify how to sort the array items. When such a callback function, normally called compareFunction, is supplied, the array elements are sorted according to the return value of the compareFunction: If compareFunction(a,b) returns a value less than 0 for two elements a and b, then a will come before b. If compareFunction(a,b) returns a value greater than 0 for two elements a and b, then b will come before a. If compareFunction(a,b) returns a value equal to 0 for two elements a and b, then a and b will remain unchanged.

# Return a Sorted Array Without Changing the Original Array
A side effect of the sort method is that it changes the order of the elements in the original array. In other words, it mutates the array in place. One way to avoid this is to first concatenate an empty array to the one being sorted (remember that slice and concat return a new array), then run the sort method.

## Challenge
Use the sort method in the nonMutatingSort function to sort the elements of an array in ascending order. The function should return a new array, and not mutate the globalArray variable.
```js
const globalArray = [5, 6, 3, 2, 9];

function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return arr.concat([]).sort(function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  });

  // Only change code above this line
}

nonMutatingSort(globalArray);
```
# Split a String into an Array Using the split Method
The split method splits a string into an array of strings. It takes an argument for the delimiter, which can be a character to use to break up the string or a regular expression. For example, if the delimiter is a space, you get an array of words, and if the delimiter is an empty string, you get an array of each character in the string.

Here are two examples that split one string by spaces, then another by digits using a regular expression:
```js
const str = "Hello World";
const bySpace = str.split(" ");

const otherString = "How9are7you2today";
const byDigits = otherString.split(/\d/);
```
bySpace would have the value ```["Hello", "World"]``` and byDigits would have the value ```["How", "are", "you", "today"]```.

Since strings are immutable, the split method makes it easier to work with them.

## Challenge
Use the split method inside the splitify function to split str into an array of words. The function should return the array. Note that the words are not always separated by spaces, and the array should not contain punctuation.
```js
function splitify(str) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return str.split(/\W/);

  // Only change code above this line
}

splitify("Hello World,I-am code");
```
# Combine an Array into a String Using the join Method
The join method is used to join the elements of an array together to create a string. It takes an argument for the delimiter that is used to separate the array elements in the string.
```js
const arr = ["Hello", "World"];
const str = arr.join(" ");
```
str would have a value of the string *Hello World*.

## Challenge
Use the join method (among others) inside the sentensify function to make a sentence from the words in the string str. The function should return a string. For example, I-like-Star-Wars would be converted to I like Star Wars. For this challenge, do not use the replace method.
```js
function sentensify(str) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return str.split(/\W/).join(" ");
  // Only change code above this line
}

sentensify("May-the-force-be-with-you");
```
# Apply Functional Programming to Convert Strings to URL Slugs
Many content management sites (CMS) have the titles of a post added to part of the URL for simple bookmarking purposes. For example, if you write a Medium post titled Stop Using Reduce, it's likely the URL would have some form of the title string in it (.../stop-using-reduce). 

## Challenge
Fill in the urlSlug function so it converts a string title and returns the hyphenated version for the URL. You can use any of the methods covered in this section, and don't use replace. Here are the requirements:

The input is a string with spaces and title-cased words

The output is a string with the spaces between words replaced by a hyphen (-)

The output should be all lower-cased letters

The output should not have any spaces

```js
// Only change code below this line
function urlSlug(title) {
  return title
  .toLowerCase()
  .split(/\s+/)
  .filter(substr => substr !== "")
  .join("-");

}
// Only change code above this line
urlSlug(" Winter Is  Coming");
```
# Use the every Method to Check that Every Element in an Array Meets a Criteria
The every method works with arrays to check if every element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value - true if all values meet the criteria, false if not.

For example, the following code would check if every element in the numbers array is less than 10:
```js
const numbers = [1, 5, 8, 0, 10, 11];

numbers.every(function(currentValue) {
  return currentValue < 10;
});
```
The every method would return false here.

## Challenge
Use the every method inside the checkPositive function to check if every element in arr is positive. The function should return a Boolean value.
```js
function checkPositive(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return arr.every(currentValue => currentValue > 0);
  // Only change code above this line
}

checkPositive([1, 2, 3, -4, 5]);
```
# Use the some Method to Check that Any Elements in an Array Meet a Criteria
The some method works with arrays to check if any element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value - true if any of the values meet the criteria, false if not.

For example, the following code would check if any element in the numbers array is less than 10:
```js
const numbers = [10, 50, 8, 220, 110, 11];

numbers.some(function(currentValue) {
  return currentValue < 10;
});
```
The some method would return true.

## Challenge
Use the some method inside the checkPositive function to check if any element in arr is positive. The function should return a Boolean value.
```js
function checkPositive(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return arr.some(value => value > 0);
  // Only change code above this line
}

checkPositive([1, 2, 3, -4, 5]);
```
# Introduction to Currying and Partial Application
The arity of a function is the number of arguments it requires. Currying a function means to convert a function of N arity into N functions of arity 1.

In other words, it restructures a function so it takes one argument, then returns another function that takes the next argument, and so on.
```js
function unCurried(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

function curried(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}

const curried = x => y => x + y

curried(1)(2)
```
curried(1)(2) would return 3.

This is useful in your program if you can't supply all the arguments to a function at one time. You can save each function call into a variable, which will hold the returned function reference that takes the next argument when it's available. Here's an example using the curried function in the example above:
```js
const funcForY = curried(1);
console.log(funcForY(2)); // 3
```
Similarly, partial application can be described as applying a few arguments to a function at a time and returning another function that is applied to more arguments. 
```js
function impartial(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}

const partialFn = impartial.bind(this, 1, 2);
partialFn(10); // 13
```
## Challenge
Fill in the body of the add function so it uses currying to add parameters x, y, and z.
```js
function add(x) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return function(y) {
    return function(z) {
      return x + y + z;
    }
  }

  // Only change code above this line
}

add(10)(20)(30);
```
