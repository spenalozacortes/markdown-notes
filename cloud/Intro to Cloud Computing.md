# Introduction to Cloud Computing

## Introduction to Cloud Computing

### What Is Cloud Computing?
For this course, we will define _cloud computing_ as delivering computing services over the internet by a cloud provider. These services range from databases to networking to data storage.

The cloud is not one computer in any particular location. Any set of servers dedicated to providing services to other computers is its own cloud. When we say “the cloud,” we refer to many different clouds owned by many different companies. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft provide large _public clouds_ accessible to anyone. Thousands of small businesses also host small _private clouds_ accessible only to their employees.

### Where Did Cloud Computing Come from?
In the early 2000s, large websites needed the ability to handle billions of requests per day. Handling this kind of traffic required the creation of data centers. _Data centers_ are buildings that are made specifically to house computer systems. A data center is often capable of supporting thousands of servers within one building. These data centers allowed for the creation of the first cloud-based products. These products included Amazon shopping, Google’s search engine, and Gmail.

Amazon engineers proposed that separating infrastructure from architecture would achieve more flexibility. Having applications able to load in and out of different servers would allow for more scaling and redundancy. The engineers also believed that offering this separation would be attractive to external companies as well. This idea was the beginning of Amazon Web Services (AWS).

### What Is Cloud Computing Used for?

#### Storage
Today’s businesses collect a lot of data, which needs a massive amount of disk space. The days in which a company could hold all its data in file cabinets are long gone. The cloud offers storage capacity far beyond what most companies can create. The scale of the data centers allows for cheap backups and storage of vast amounts of data.

#### Analytics
The raw data that a business collects can be a jumbled mess to read directly. The data often needs to be processed to make any sense to a person. Processing the massive amount of data that businesses collect requires a lot of computing power. Companies can use cloud provider data centers to process large amounts of data.

#### Infrastructure
The massive data centers of cloud providers contain enough servers to support millions of businesses. Owning the servers necessary to host applications needs a lot of time, money, and work for a business. Businesses are now often turning this responsibility over to cloud providers. Cloud providers have so much computing power available that they can provide infrastructure at a fraction of the cost of a business hosting their servers.

### Why Use Cloud Computing?
Owning our infrastructure requires us to purchase, configure, and maintain the servers that run our services. Managing infrastructure requires a lot of work and expense. More companies than ever need servers and infrastructure. New customers can flood a company’s product, creating a need for massive amounts of infrastructure. When these customers leave, the company can be left with much more infrastructure than needed. Cloud computing solves many of these issues.

Cloud computing slashes the time, cost, and effort required to maintain computing services. Cloud providers offer computing power at prices far below what it would cost to keep our servers. We can configure servers in milliseconds. The number of servers can scale with the needs of the business almost instantly.

Cloud providers have data centers and host locations all over the world. Using a cloud provider allows a company to provide high-speed connections to customers in diverse geographical locations.

Cloud computing allows us to have a highly available and fault-tolerant infrastructure. A _highly available_ infrastructure aims to be usable by customers as close to 100% of the time as possible. Cloud providers grant companies the ability to reproduce infrastructure in multiple data centers cheaply. This redundancy makes our systems more _fault-tolerant_, meaning that issues can occur, and our systems will keep going. By duplicating infrastructure across data centers, if one fails, another takes its place.

### What Are the Risks of Using Cloud Computing?
Owning our infrastructure provides complete control over it. Our data stays within our business. We can approve each expense of maintaining the data centers. When a part of the infrastructure breaks, we can send a team member to fix it.

Using cloud computing, we lose much of that control. Our data becomes stored on the cloud provider’s servers. The cloud provider determines the cost we pay. We are trusting the provider to be reliable and not have data center outages. We also have to learn the provider’s way of working with their infrastructure because we no longer have direct access. The training to learn to manipulate cloud services can take time and money.

Because numerous companies store their data within a few cloud providers, the providers have access to massive amounts of data. Companies should take care to preserve the privacy of sensitive customer data. Cloud providers having access to all of this data could set up the industry for enormous data breaches at scales never seen before.

### Review
In this article, we described a high-level overview of cloud computing, introducing its uses, benefits, and consequences. Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over a network. The cloud allows companies to gain access to the storage and computing infrastructure of tech giants. We can give responsibility for our infrastructure to someone else. Yet, using the cloud comes with a reduction in the amount of control we have.


## Careers in Cloud

### Cloud Foundational Skills

#### A Basic Understanding of the Cloud
It is necessary to develop an understanding of the general cloud landscape. We should know:

- What is the cloud?
- Who are the major cloud providers?
- What can the cloud offer?

#### Setting up a cloud environment
Cloud users should be able to set up their local computers for accessing cloud services. These services are usually accessed using command line tools or web management consoles. Either way, a cloud user should be able to access cloud offerings using their computer.

#### High-level knowledge of cloud services
Anyone starting a cloud career should have some understanding of cloud offerings. This might include the broad categories that cloud services fall under; compute, security, storage, and more. Knowledge in these areas will allow the cloud user to have informed discussions on cloud solutions.

#### Basic access and security
Security is a vital aspect of using the cloud. Improper cloud security could give someone access to a company’s infrastructure and data. A cloud user should be familiar with concepts such as permissions, roles, users, and groups.

#### Configuring and deploying cloud solutions
An entry-level user of the cloud should be able to create and launch basic cloud services. These tasks might involve creating and launching a server instance or a database.

### Cloud Roles
There are many different roles in the cloud. Each role focuses on different aspects of utilizing the cloud for a business. Some roles focus on the nitty-gritty of implementation. Other roles are big picture orchestrators of large systems. Here are some of the different roles in a cloud career.

#### Cloud Developer
The cloud developer uses cloud services to create desired business outcomes. They might develop functionality by integrating cloud services into an application. Cloud engineers are often going to be using programming languages. Common languages for working with cloud services include Python and Go.

#### Cloud Administrator
The cloud administrator creates and manages the services that the business uses. The cloud developer will be connecting these services with their programs. The administrator focuses more on the configuration and maintenance of the cloud services.

The services and technologies used by the cloud administrator will depend greatly on the company they are working at.

#### Cloud Architect
Cloud architects are responsible for the design and construction of cloud systems. The cloud architect determines the services used and how they connect. They are responsible for the high-level technical cloud strategy.

The cloud administrator will expand, configure, and maintain these systems. The cloud developer will use pieces of this cloud architecture to conduct their work.

### Specialties

#### SecOps (Security Operations) / Cloud Security Engineer
The SecOps or cloud security engineer aims to prevent misuse of a company’s cloud infrastructure. This misuse can range from mistakes to malicious external users. Security engineers will often focus on controlling access to cloud services.

A SecOps engineer will require advanced knowledge of networking, data privacy, and security best practices. These tasks might involve defining roles for different teams, restricting permissions, and encryption. The security engineer protects data and defends the cloud system from external attacks.

#### FinOps (Financial Operations) / Cloud Financial Engineer
The FinOps engineer or cloud financial engineer works on the finances of managing and running cloud services. A FinOps engineer will look for ways to improve cloud processes and service efficiency. They also might make extensive use of service logs to identify improvement opportunities. A FinOps engineer requires detailed knowledge of the prices of cloud offerings. These engineers will propose, test, and implement cost-effective changes.

#### DevOps (Development Operations) / Site Reliability Engineer
The DevOps or Site Reliability engineer combines infrastructure and development work, emphasizing automation. This type of engineer seeks to find ways to improve processes for developing a system. DevOps engineers will need a deep knowledge of development processes and tooling. Tools used by a DevOps engineer can include Docker, Kubernetes, Git, and Jenkins. Some important aspects of DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering work include:

- CI/CD Pipelines: A series of steps to make changes to a project automatically built, tested, and deployed.
- Monitoring: A practice enabling information to flow from our systems to our developers
- Resiliency: A practice of making our systems able to continue to function even under problematic conditions.


## Cloud Deployment Models
A _cloud deployment model_ describes:

- Who has access to the cloud?
- The degree to which the organization has control over the cloud.

Organizations might choose between deployment models based on:

- Controlling who uses the same cloud as them.
- The degree to which the cloud needs to be specialized to fit their needs.
- The cost of using a particular deployment model.

In this article, we will describe the main types of deployment models used in the cloud today:

- Public clouds
- Private Clouds
- Community Clouds
- Hybrid Clouds

### Public cloud
A _public cloud_ makes its computing services available to anyone. When we use a public cloud provider, their servers are processing our requests and those of millions of other customers. Public cloud providers offer a huge variety of cloud-based services for their customers to use, applicable to almost any business.

#### Benefits
A public cloud offers:

- Pay-per-usage models, which means customers only pay for what they use.
- The ability to handle large amounts of traffic across many customers.
- Not having to worry about the hardware, that’s all taken care of by the cloud provider.
- Simple replication of information and services across machines and data centers. Replication ensures that if a component fails, another contains the lost data.

#### Challenges
Some challenges of utilizing a public cloud include:

- We are limited to what the provider offers
- No direct access to hardware
- Trusting the provider with data and processes

For those seeking control over their infrastructure, a private cloud may be appropriate.

### Private cloud
A _private cloud_ is a set of cloud computing resources dedicated to a single organization. Either a customer or a third party can own a private cloud’s infrastructure. No other customers work with the same machines as those used by the private cloud. The services offered by a private cloud are up to the maintainers of the private cloud.

Companies needing a private cloud usually have strict data storage and access requirements. Common private cloud owners include governments, financial institutions, and medical organizations.

#### Benefits
The primary benefit of a private cloud is the increased control that the customer has over its usage:

- All the cloud’s capacity is available for use for one organization. The amount of infrastructure capacity available is up to the private cloud owner.
- Sometimes, companies must not share infrastructure to comply with regulations. Having a private cloud can allow companies to use the cloud while staying in compliance.
- The owners can tailor the cloud infrastructure to their needs.

#### Challenges
Some of the challenges of using a private cloud include:

- Using a private cloud eliminates some of the benefits that a public cloud provides. The cost of private cloud provider infrastructure is much higher than similar public infrastructure. The user owning the infrastructure is even more costly!
- Because of the price tag that a private cloud entails, private cloud users may consider whether some services can run on shared infrastructure.

### Community Cloud
A _community cloud_ describes organizations with similar needs sharing ownership of a cloud. Community clouds are an intermediate option between public and private clouds. This model is an excellent option for organizations who share hardware specialization needs.

#### Benefits
A community cloud offers:

- Only the organization group may access the cloud, increasing security.
- The group can customize the cloud to meet their shared needs.
- The ability to divide the management work and costs between the organizations.

#### Challenges
Some issues that can arise with a community cloud include:

- Requires making decisions as a group of organizations.
- Each organization must make sensitive data secure.
- Infrastructure needs to be able to meet the needs of all organizations at the same time.

### Hybrid cloud
A _hybrid cloud_ describes a company utilizing more than one deployment model. A company uses a hybrid model if it relies on a combination of public, private, or community clouds.

#### Benefits
This model allows companies to deploy their sensitive services in a private cloud and others in public or community models. The benefits of using a hybrid cloud include:

- Each service using a public cloud costs less than a private one.
- The organization can use deployment models according to their best fit.

#### Challenges
Some challenges of using a hybrid cloud include:

- The hybrid organization will have to pay for both private and public cloud usage.
- Using multiple cloud systems can increase the complexity of managing their services.

### Multicloud
A multicloud is a system that uses multiple clouds of the same deployment type. This model differs from hybrid clouds, which use multiple cloud systems of different deployment types.

A system using a private cloud and a public cloud would then be a hybrid cloud system. A system using two public clouds would be a multicloud system.

Hybrid multiclouds are systems that meet the definition of both hybrid clouds and multiclouds. A system using a private cloud and two public clouds would be a hybrid multicloud.

#### Benefits
A multicloud or hybrid multicloud allows for flexibility in choosing cloud service providers. There are many reasons why we choose one provider over another:

- Providers compete with each other on cost, and often have different prices
- Some providers specialize in providing certain types of services
- Sometimes only one provider will have a certain service

#### Challenges
Challenges of using a multicloud system include:

- Training teams to use multiple cloud systems
- The complexity of dealing with many different services and multiple platforms.

### Review
- Public clouds: accessible to any customer over the internet
- Private clouds: accessible to only one organization
- Community clouds: accessed by a select group of organizations
- Hybrid clouds: a deployment model consisting of combinations of other deployment models
- Multi-clouds: combinations of multiple of the same deployment model


## Types of Cloud Services
Many types of businesses are moving into the cloud. It can be difficult to distinguish between what each cloud provider is offering. To assist with this issue, we can group cloud offerings into service model categories. Using these categories makes it more clear what a company is offering to its customers. These categories include:

- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

While there are more “as a Service” acronyms, the trio of SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS are the most well-established.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
Software as a Service or SaaS offerings are cloud applications that are available over the internet. SaaS applications don’t need installation on customers’ computers. The data storage and processing in these applications happens in the cloud.

#### Benefits
Some benefits of utilizing SaaS include:

- Access to powerful functionality provided by other businesses
- No need to install, configure, or update these web-based SaaS applications

#### Challenges
Challenges when using SaaS include:

- A lack of control over application management and configuration
- It can be difficult to port information from one SaaS application to another
- Reliance on the provider for security and access to the application

#### Examples
Some common examples of SaaS applications include:

- Dropbox
- Gmail
- Google Docs

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
A Platform as a Service or PaaS solution simplifies creating and deploying cloud applications. PaaS solution tools guide customers in the creation, testing, and deployment of applications. The applications that we create using PaaS or IaaS (coming up next) can be used to create SaaS applications of our own!

#### Benefits
The benefits of using a PaaS solution include:

- Low management of application infrastructure
- Lower cost than hosting an application ourselves
- Simple integration of other cloud services
- Automatic scaling to meet traffic demands

#### Challenges
Customers of PaaS solutions may struggle with:

- Limited customization options
- Difficulty moving applications between platforms

#### Examples
PaaS offerings by the top cloud providers (Amazon, Microsoft, and Google) include:

- AWS ElasticBeanStalk
- Azure App Service
- Google App Engine

Companies and entrepreneurs use PaaS when they want to deploy a cloud application without managing its infrastructure.

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
An Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solution provides customers with indirect access to cloud infrastructure. Customers of IaaS manage the infrastructure via tooling and APIs. IaaS customers do not have direct physical access to the hardware but have more control than with SaaS or PaaS. This allows IaaS customers to virtually administrate the infrastructure.

#### Benefits
Using an IaaS solution offers benefits such as:

- Services are more customizable than PaaS solutions
- Access to scalable and reliable infrastructure
- Cost can be tailored to the needs of cloud infrastructure

#### Challenges
Difficulties with using IaaS include:

- More complex configuration and management of services
- Possible extensive training to create secure and cost-effective services

#### Examples
Popular IaaS offerings include:

- Google Compute Engine
- Azure Virtual Machines
- Amazon EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute)

Companies use IaaS when they want more control over their application infrastructure. IaaS is for those who have specialized needs and expertise in infrastructure management.

### Review
- Software as a Service (SaaS) provides application software over the internet.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) simplifies creating applications within the cloud.
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) allows for the creation of customized offerings.


## Cloud Providers

### What is a Cloud Provider?
A cloud provider is a company that offers access to its cloud infrastructure for other companies to use. Customers are able to interact with this cloud via infrastructure, platform, or software as a service offerings.

Cloud providers tend to charge customers using a pay-per-use model. This pricing model is like a utility bill, in which customers pay for the amount of the utility they use. Cloud providers base their billing on the number of services used by each customer. This model allows the customer to access and pay for only as much infrastructure as needed.

### Major Cloud Providers
The following providers make up more than half of the total market share. When most companies are thinking of moving to the cloud, they consider AWS, Azure, and GCP.

#### AWS (Amazon Web Services)
[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) launched in 2006 with initial storage and compute offerings. These services were some of the first of their kind, allowing Amazon to dominate the market. Over the years AWS has remained the largest cloud provider.

##### Strengths
- Most established provider
- Hundreds of services spanning Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Strong free tier of services to try out offerings

##### Weaknesses
- Pricing complexity: it can be difficult to estimate the total cost of an AWS system due to the number of options and tiers affecting cost.
- Lock-in: Getting our applications out of AWS may require extensive work, making us “locked in” to using AWS’ service. This problem is known as vendor lock-in.

#### Microsoft Azure
[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) launched in 2010 and has its own impressive collection of services. Azure offers thousands of different services that span a large variety of use cases.

##### Strengths
- Strong SaaS offerings such as Microsoft Office 365
- Decades of experience providing enterprise server software and support
- Emphasizes hybrid cloud approaches, managing both private clouds and Azure

##### Weaknesses
- Ease of use: a common complaint of Azure is that its training materials are not sufficient to use the platform effectively
- Customer support: many customers describe difficulty in getting individual attention from Azure’s team

#### GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) became available in 2011, adding to its services over time.

##### Strengths
- Simpler pricing structure
- Tends to be the least expensive option
- Specialized in big data and machine learning

##### Weaknesses
- Offers fewer services than Azure or AWS
- Fewer global data centers

### Other Cloud Providers
The top three cloud providers are by no means alone in the market. Besides AWS, Azure, and GCP, there are many other cloud providers with their own specializations.

- [Red Hat Cloud Servcies](https://www.redhat.com/) brings extensive experience with Linux administration with a focus on security.
- [Alibaba Cloud](https://alibabacloud.com/) offers services similar to those of AWS with a focus on the China region.
- [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) optimizes for scale, targeting large enterprise companies.
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) focuses on small development teams looking to quickly create cloud-based applications.
